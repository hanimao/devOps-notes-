==Merge Conflicts==

- When you do not do a GIT pull after a merge request your local machine is not up to date with remote repository. Then you will branch off to a version of the code which is older. 
- Occurs when Git cannot reconcile difference between two commits and requires manual resolution. 

git branch branchname
git checkout branchname 
git add README.md
git commit -m
